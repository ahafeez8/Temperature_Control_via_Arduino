# Temperature_Control_via_Arduino
This was a small project to monitor changes in temperature as monitered by temperature sensor via Arduino. 
LEDs were connected for HIGH, LOW, OK temperature to present a temperature monitoring system prototype. 
This was programmed on Arduino Mega using DallasTemperature and ONEWire libraries.
